# credit_fault

This Notebook is the result of my Ecole Polytechnique's *MAP569 - Machine Learning II* course project, where we tried to predict whether a current client will fail to repay his/her credit.

We cleaned the data (in *CreditTraining.csv* file), created new relevant features, implemented various ML algorithms - among which we picked the best by cross-validation - before tuning the hyperparameters so as to have the best possible results.

I realized this project with Jean-Pe√Øc Chou.
